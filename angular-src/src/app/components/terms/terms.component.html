        <h2 id="PII">1. Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>Certain visitors to Liturgy Consulting's websites choose to interact with Liturgy Consulting in ways that
            require Liturgy Consulting to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
            that Liturgy Consulting gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
            leave a comment at http://litcons.eu to provide a username and email address.</p>

        <p></p>
        <h2 id="Security">2. Security</h2>
        <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission

            up to date with what's going on with Liturgy Consulting and our products. We primarily use our blog to
            communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a
            request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to
            publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Liturgy
